The study of more than 100 incidents determined the median number of people killed or wounded in all active shooter situations was five. The study documented only nine incidents out of dozens in which the number of people shot was 14 or higher. Conclusions about the number of deaths when an armed civilian takes action are also problematic because very limited data exists. The author of the study agrees its logical to assume casualties would be lower when civilians intervene before police arrive, but his research documented very few incidents that were actually stopped because a civilian was carrying a gun.

He once said that he wouldn't run for Senate as an independent, and then said he would support the Republican nominee. But this fact check is about more than flip-flopping. It's about Crist attacking Rubio for the very same positions Crist held just six months ago. There, the case is much more difficult to make. When it comes to health care, Social Security, immigration, embryonic stem cell research and Roe vs.  Wade, we find Crist's positions are either unchanged, or he hasn't used them as a line of attack against Rubio. But gay adoption is a slightly different story. Crist said he supported keeping the gay adoption ban in place as a Republican as recently as eight months ago, but now says he supports the ban being lifted. And he's using that new position to link Rubio to a tea party favorite like Jim DeMint in order to bolster the argument that Rubio's extreme. The caveat is that as far back as 2006 Crist was accused by Republicans of supporting gay adoptions in Florida and has given differing statements on the issue. In that case, Crist's flip-flopping helps his argument.","['pretty', 'written', 'book', 'noting', 'position', 'oil', 'drilling', 'shifted', 'position', 'federal', 'health', 'care', 'said', 'run',

It is in the matter of foreign policy that Romney lays out the most aggressive case against Obama, warning that the United States needs to maintain its military dominance in the world, particularly in the face of threats from China, Russia and Islamic jihadists. Obama, Romney writes, needs to ""proudly defend her rather than continually apologize for her. ""Here, we're checking Romney's statement that Obama ""has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision"" and a host of other reasons. If you think American presidents should never admit to any sort of error at any time, you might find yourself in philosophical agreement with Romney's criticisms.

However, Loesch spoke as if these people, whatever their number, did not find replacement coverage. In reality, fewer than 1 million people who had been part of the individual insurance market ended up with no coverage at all.

274,"When I left the Senate, we were on a trajectory towards a balanced budget.",left senate trajectory balanced budget ,"['left', 'senate', 'trajectory', 'balanced', 'budget']","Allen, trying to refute charges he voted to run up federal deficits, said the U. S.  was ""on a trajectory towards a balanced budget"" when he left the Senate in 2007. Allens campaign cites a 2007 CBO report that said Washington was on the road to budget surpluses, starting in 2012. But those projections were based on the assumption that the Bush tax cuts would end as scheduled in 2010. And Allen has maintained since at least 2006 that the tax reductions should be made permanent. Had Allen prevailed on the tax cuts, figures in the 2007 CBO report point to the deficit slowly rising in raw dollars over the next eight years.

Department of Transportation secretary said that the state wouldn't be liable for overruns. And legislators were keen on having it happen that way before fully embracing the high-speed rail line.

The most recent estimate from the state health care agency says a series of changes to Medicaid could wind up costing about $1. 4 billion a year, but that number includes things beyond the expansion to Medicaid that Scott was talking about. For instance, about $400 million is tied to increased reimbursement payments to Medicaid providers. But the state isn't required to pay that out. And another estimated $516 million will pay for people who are eligible for Medicaid under its current provisions but have not enrolled. They would remain eligible whether or not the program is expanded in Florida. That leaves about $500 million in estimated new costs for Medicaid patients under the federal government expansion.

Texas tied with five states for the third-highest rate in 2011, of 86 percent. Then again, three states had higher rates, meaning Texas might better be described as fourth-ranked.

Also, by another measure, comparing the number of graduates one year to students in ninth grade four years earlier, Texas remained among middling states for 2009-10, with a 79 percent completion rate. Finally, since it's not accurate to compare these rates devised in different ways, Perrys reference to a ""significant turnaround"" depends on just the three years of rates measured in the newest way.

Virginians, like residents of all states, are subject to new taxes to help support the ACA. The payments pour into the U. S.  Treasury where they are mixed with other tax dollars and piped out to federal programs. Theres no tracking of individual coins in this flow of money and its possible that some deposits from Virginia could end up helping Medicaid recipients in other states. But contrary to McAuliffes statement, theres no direct connection between Virginias decision on expansion and what happens to Medicaid in other states. The goal of expansion is to offer Medicaid insurance to people earning up 133 percent of the U. S.  poverty line.

907,Women account for 92.3 percent of the jobs lost under Obama.,woman account percent job lost obama ,"['woman', 'account', 'percent', 'job', 'lost', 'obama']","Romney's website said that women account for 92. 3 percent of jobs lost under Obama. By comparing job figures with January 2009 and March 2012 and weighing them against womens job figures from the same periods, Saul came up with 92. 3 percent. First, Obama cannot be held entirely accountable for the employment picture on the day he took office, just as he could not be given credit if times had been booming. Second, by choosing figures from January 2009, months into the recession, the statement ignored the millions of jobs lost before then, when most of the job loss fell on men. In every recession, men are the first to take the hit, followed by women. It's a historical pattern, Stevenson told us, not an effect of Obama's policies. Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, said much of the decline for women was in the public sector. ""To the extent there have been excessive job losses among women, a lot of it has to do with the fact that there has been an enormous reduction in state and local government employment,"" Bartlett said. ""The decline . . . has been especially pronounced in this recession as opposed to other recessions. ""This chart from the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-backed group, bears that out. In earlier recessions, public-sector jobs began increasing again as the economy stabilized. After the most recent recession, they have continued to disappear. Again, these are jobs heavily held by women. Bartlett added that many of those government jobs were eliminated in states controlled by Republican governors and legislatures. This story in the Atlantic cited a study by the liberal Roosevelt Institute finding that the 11 states that went Republican in 2010 accounted for 40. 5 percent of all state and local government job losses. Jeff Hayes is a senior research analyst with the Institute for Womens Policy Research, an organization affiliated with George Washington Universitys public policy graduate program that receives contributions from groups including the Annie E.  Casey Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Hayes added that ""theres a lag before the lost tax revenue catches up and government jobs are lost. ""If you break out the 683,000 jobs women lost between January 2009 and March 2012, 64 percent were in government and only 36 percent in the private sector. ""That leads us to a point made by Eileen Appelbaum with the left-leaning Center on Economic and Policy Research. She noted that after the first wave of money in the presidents stimulus bill had run out, Obama asked for another $23 billion in ""emergency aid"" for state and local governments. The money was sought to avert the layoffs of as many as 300,000 public school teachers, but House Republican leaders stripped it. ""You could hardly blame Obama for that,"" Appelbaum said. As for the comparison with the PolitiFact Georgia item, such direct comparisons are tricky. The Associated Press said using the 92. 3 percent figure as a measure of Obamas record on women was ""dubious at best. ""First Read, a politics blog by NBC News, had this to say: ""Does anyone believe, with a straight face, that nine in 10 job losses over the past three years have been women workers? ""And the New York Times disputed the emphasis on the job losses occurring ""under Obama. """"Presidents get too much credit or blame for changes in the business cycle. Contrary to what seems to be popular opinion, neither Mr.  Bush nor Mr.  Obama had or have the unilateral ability to steer the country into good or bad job markets. Neither would a President Romney,"" Times economics writer Catherine Rampell wrote in the Economix blog. Well conclude with this point: Experts agree that the economic recovery has not helped women as much as men. Howard Wall, an economics professor at Lindenwood University, said its fair to fault Obama for that. ""I think you have to kind of divide the timeline. Call it the Bush recession and the Obama recovery,"" Wall said. ""I dont give them (the Obama administration) credit for stopping the fall or causing the fall. They had nothing to do with that. But they own the recovery. ""Does all this mean that Obamas policies have brought hard times to women","['romney', 'website', 'said', 'woman', 'account', 'percent', 'job', 'lost', 'obama', 'comparing', 'job', 'figure',

That's more than the two years of returns Romney has released. Clinton is exaggerating a bit when he puts the ""typical"" number at 10. Over the decades, we found candidates released anywhere from 30 years of tax returns to one year.

Perhaps more important, the historians took issue with Trumps suggestion that the tactic -- if it was even used at all -- actually worked to end tensions, noting that unrest persisted for years. UPDATE, Feb.  29, 2016: After we published this story, a reader pointed us to a memoir by Pershing titled My Life Before the World War, 1860-1917, which was republished in 2013 by the University Press of Kentucky. In the memoir, Pershing writes that another commanding officer in the Philippines, Col.  Frank West, had in at least one case seen to it that bodies of Muslim insurgents ""were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins. ""In a footnote, the editor of the 2013 edition, John T.  Greenwood, cited a letter about the incident from Maj.  Gen.  J.  Franklin Bell, the commander of the Philippines Division, to Pershing: ""Of course there is nothing to be done, but I understand it has long been a custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans. I think this a good plan, for if anything will discourage the (insurgents) it is the prospect of going to hell instead of to heaven. You can rely on me to stand by you in maintaining this custom. It is the only possible thing we can do to discourage crazy fanatics.

1243,"Says Marco Rubio sold a home to a chiropractor who had been lobbying him on automobile insurance legislation and once he sold the home, for $380,000 cash, the speakers position on the issue changed.",say marco rubio sold home chiropractor lobbying automobile insurance legislation sold home cash speaker position issue changed ,"['say', 'marco', 'rubio', 'sold', 'home', 'chiropractor', 'lobbying', 'automobile', 'insurance', 'legislation', 'sold', 'home', 'cash', 'speaker', 'position', 'issue', 'changed']","This is an interesting case study in politics. Let's start by stating the obvious. Rubio would have been better off selling his house to someone other than the mother of a chiropractor who was trying to get him to extend personal injury protection. But, other than perception, there are no obvious glaring red flags about the sale. He got a good price, it seems, but not an outrageous one based on the comparable sales we examined. Also, the cash sale doesn't bother us particularly. This is a retiree who had money from a life insurance policy. As for Rubio's position on the PIP laws, he initially said he would let the mandate expire unless fraud reforms were included. Some were included in the legislation proposed by the Senate, but apparently not enough to sway Rubio. So the session ended in May 2007 without action, despite the house sale. Rubio and House leaders then worked to include additional fraud protections and were able to reach a deal more to their liking. Rubio, in fact, called to include PIP legislation during a special session. The ultimate bill that passed included a few more anti-fraud measures, but seems not to have stopped much fraud, according to state statistics. We're not sure why it took five extra months to include the minor changes to the PIP legislation, or why House leaders didn't propose the changes during the session. Crist condensed the facts when he said that the chiropractor lobbying Rubio bought the house. It was the chiropractor's mother who made the purchase. He also condensed the timeline and slightly manipulated the chain of events when he said, ""once he sold the home . . . the speaker's position on the issue changed. ""We think there's at least a debate on whether he changed his position at all. Rubio never said he opposed extending PIP. He said he opposed extending it without proper protections against fraud. A version of the bill proposed during a 2007 special legislative session emerged that included fraud protectionshe wanted.","['interesting', 'case', 'study', 'politics', 'let', 'start', 'stating',
